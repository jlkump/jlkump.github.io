									<h1>Inverse Kinematics</h1>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>
										The goal of this project was to implement an Inverse Kinematics system into Godot using 
										GDExtension that allowed for various bone lengths, number of bones, and number of IK chains.
										I also had the goal of implementing rotational constraints for each bone joint, but
										found many difficulties with the implementation. Despite that, I will still cover
										the different approaches I used as well as the theoretical implementation.
									</p>
									<p>
										So, first of all, what is Inverse Kinematics? 
										Inverse Kinematics or IK is a way of animating a set of bones to have 
										realistic placement and orientation given some target position.
										This is really useful for the animation of limbs like hands and feet since it is much easier to give limbs 
										a target position rather than define the rotations of each joint in a chain of bones.
									</p>
									<p>
										My implementation uses FABRIK, a method defined in the paper 
										<em>FABRIK: A fast, iterative solver for the Inverse Kinematics problem</em>
										by Andreas Aristidou &amp; Joan Lasenby. Below is the showcase video and
										following that is a walkthrough of my process and implementation.

									<h2>Process</h2>

									<h3>FABRIK Method</h3>
									<p>
										To begin, we need an understanding of FABRIK, the method I used 
										for my implementation of IK. FABRIK stands for Forward And Backward Reaching
										Inverse Kinematics. It is actually a pretty simple
										method and the name gives us a big hint on how the method works.
										Namely, there is a forward-reaching and backward-reaching stage,
										both of which have similar steps.

											<p>
												Firstly, we need a defined chain of bones and joints for a
												model. I did this with some simple models made both in Godot
												and Blender, but normally bones would be defined by an animation
												rigger or modeler. For the sake of explanation, we consider
												a chain of bones with only four joints. 
											</p>
											<blockquote>
												Bones define how sections of a model 
												will move relative to the changes in the bone orientation 
												and positions, making moving model limbs easier since we don't
												have to move every joint individually.
											</blockquote>
											<p>
												The forward-reaching stage is fairly
												straight-forward, with only two major steps:
												First moving the end effector (the end joint of the bone chain) to the target position;
												And second, adjusting previous joints, putting them back at the appropriate distance
												from the bone before it.
											</p>
											<p>
												The backward-reaching stage is just as simple,
												with the process just being performed in reverse. First, the
												first joint is placed back at the initial position before
												performing IK. Then, the joints are adjusted in the same way,
												conserving the distances between bone joints.
											</p>
											<p>
												Lastly, both stages are performed multiple times until the end effector
												is within some threshold of the target or an iteration maximum is reached.
												That's the general idea, however, more specifically, before
												we begin performing FABRIK, we first check to see if the target is
												even within range. If it is, then perform FABRIK, otherwise, we
												have the bones stretch towards the target (which doesn't require
												the iterative approach above).
											</p>

												The image to the left comes from the FABRIK paper and showcases the 
												forward-reaching stage of FABRIK.

									<h3>Godot Implementation</h3>
									<p>
										Now, understanding the method, we can discuss my implementation in GDExtension.
										I initially planned to incorporate IK changes into Godot using the existing scene-tree 
										hierarchy for transforms, but found that the result was fairly buggy. When I 
										modified the transform data, it would not have the expected result. I 
										think this was due to the scene-tree hierarchy enforcing transform updates to children
										nodes after the positions were already in the correct spot.
									</p>
									<p>
										To fix this, my system works outside of the Godot scene-tree, querying the position of
										some list of <code><a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_node3d.html">Node3D</a></code>s 
										(representing the joints), performing FABRIK, then updating
										the global positions and orientations of the <code>Node3D</code>s when finished. Specifically,
										this was implemented using a class called <code>InverseKinematicChain</code>, which 
										derived from the Godot <code><a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_node.html">Node</a></code> 
										class. The class can be configured with an input set of <code>Node3D</code>s which become the 
										joint positions for the bones. The initial 
										distances between the nodes are the initial distances between the joints and are 
										kept constant. 
									</p>

										<div class="col-8">
											<p>
												With this, ik works, but only assuming that the ik chain doesn't move. 
												If the chain were attached to some larger model, the chain would ignore the scene-tree 
												hierarchy of transforms. To fix this, I simply put a marker node at the location of 
												the chain's starting position and update the first joint's position to be 
												placed at this node before each ik calculation. 
											</p>
											<p>
												With that fixed, unconstrained IK finally works completely with arbitrary size and 
												model hierarchies. To add in some more realistic movement, I have an IK controller 
												class, which has some IK chains that it animates based on the movement of the player, 
												extrapolating the speed of the movement of the player to predict joint placement. 
												Also, I added a resting position to which the legs will try to return to if the movement 
												has been still for some amount of time.
											</p>
											<p>
												All these properties can be edited within the editor for ease of use, the appearance
												of which is shown to the right.
