									<h1>Inverse Kinematics</h1>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>
										The goal of this project was to implement an Inverse Kinematics system into Godot using 
										GDExtension that allowed for various bone lengths, number of bones, and number of IK chains.
										I also had the goal of implementing rotational constraints for each bone joint, but
										found many difficulties with the implementation. Despite that, I will still cover
										the different approaches I used as well as the theoretical implementation.
									</p>
									<p>
										So, first of all, what is Inverse Kinematics? 
										Inverse Kinematics or IK is a way of animating a set of bones to have 
										realistic placement and orientation given some target position.
										This is really useful for the animation of limbs like hands and feet since it is much easier to give limbs 
										a target position rather than define the rotations of each joint in a chain of bones.
									</p>
									<p>
										My implementation uses FABRIK, a method defined in the paper 
										<em>FABRIK: A fast, iterative solver for the Inverse Kinematics problem</em>
										by Andreas Aristidou &amp; Joan Lasenby. Below is the showcase video and
										following that is a walkthrough of my process and implementation. Here is
										the <a class="icon brands fa-github" href="https://github.com/jlkump/ik-godot-extension">Github link</a>.

									<h2>Process</h2>
									<h3>FABRIK Method</h3>
									<p>
										To begin, we need an understanding of FABRIK, the method I used 
										for my implementation of IK. FABRIK stands for Forward And Backward Reaching
										Inverse Kinematics. It is actually a pretty simple
										method and the name gives us a big hint on how the method works.
										Namely, there is a forward-reaching and backward-reaching stage,
										both of which have similar steps.

											<p>
												Firstly, we need a defined chain of bones and joints for a
												model. I did this with some simple models made both in Godot
												and Blender, but normally bones would be defined by an animation
												rigger or modeler. For the sake of explanation, we consider
												a chain of bones with only four joints. 
											</p>
											<blockquote>
												Bones define how sections of a model 
												will move relative to the changes in the bone orientation 
												and positions, making moving model limbs easier since we don't
												have to move every joint individually.
											</blockquote>
											<p>
												The forward-reaching stage is fairly
												straight-forward, with only two major steps:
												First moving the end effector (the end joint of the bone chain) to the target position;
												And second, adjusting previous joints, putting them back at the appropriate distance
												from the bone before it.
											</p>
											<p>
												The backward-reaching stage is just as simple,
												with the process just being performed in reverse. First, the
												first joint is placed back at the initial position before
												performing IK. Then, the joints are adjusted in the same way,
												conserving the distances between bone joints.
											</p>
											<p>
												Lastly, both stages are performed multiple times until the end effector
												is within some threshold of the target or an iteration maximum is reached.
												That's the general idea, however, more specifically, before
												we begin performing FABRIK, we first check to see if the target is
												even within range. If it is, then perform FABRIK, otherwise, we
												have the bones stretch towards the target (which doesn't require
												the iterative approach above).
											</p>

												forward-reaching stage of FABRIK.

									<h3>Godot Implementation</h3>
									<p>
										Now, understanding the method, we can discuss my implementation in GDExtension.
										I initially planned to incorporate IK changes into Godot using the existing scene-tree 
										hierarchy for transforms, but found that the result was fairly buggy. When I 
										modified the transform data, it would not have the expected result. I 
										think this was due to the scene-tree hierarchy enforcing transform updates to children
										nodes after the positions were already in the correct spot.
									</p>
									<p>
										To fix this, my system works outside of the Godot scene-tree, querying the position of
										some list of <code><a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_node3d.html">Node3D</a></code>s 
										(representing the joints), performing FABRIK, then updating
										the global positions and orientations of the <code>Node3D</code>s when finished. Specifically,
										this was implemented using a class called <code>InverseKinematicChain</code>, which 
										derived from the Godot <code><a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_node.html">Node</a></code> 
										class. The class can be configured with an input set of <code>Node3D</code>s which become the 
										joint positions for the bones. The initial 
										distances between the nodes are the initial distances between the joints and are 
										kept constant. 
									</p>
									<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
										<div class="col-8">
											<p>
												With this, ik works, but only assuming that the ik chain doesn't move. 
												If the chain were attached to some larger model, the chain would ignore the scene-tree 
												hierarchy of transforms. To fix this, I simply put a marker node at the location of 
												the chain's starting position and update the first joint's position to be 
												placed at this node before each ik calculation. 
											</p>
											<p>
												With that fixed, unconstrained IK finally works completely with arbitrary size and 
												model hierarchies. To add in some more realistic movement, I have an IK controller 
												class, which has some IK chains that it animates based on the movement of the player, 
												extrapolating the speed of the movement of the player to predict joint placement. 
												Also, I added a resting position to which the legs will try to return to if the movement 
												has been still for some amount of time.
											</p>
											<p>
												All these properties can be edited within the editor for ease of use, the appearance
												of which is shown to the right.

									<h3>Rotational Constraints</h3>
									<p>
										I will first walkthrough an explanation for rotational constraints
										as it is discussed in the paper. It is a bit more complicated than the
										unconstrained method, but luckily doesn't need to concern itself
										with jacobian matrices that typical rotational constraints for IK need
										to worry about.
									</p>
									<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">

											<p>
												Image from <em>FABRIK: A fast, iterative solver for the Inverse Kinematics problem</em>, figure 5.
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-8">
											<p>
												The basic idea is that there are rotational constraints on each joint which constrains
												itself in only two major axes (relative to the bone), the vertical and horizontal.
												There is also the axis that the bone can spin on, but that axis has no impact on the
												bone length and thus does not impact the IK solver.
											</p>
											<p>
												The figure to the left showcases how this is done. For the first bone, there
												are no constraints, so <code>p<sub>4</sub></code> and <code>p<sub>3</sub></code>
												are moved the same as before. However, now <code>p<sub>2</sub></code> needs to
												be checked for constraints, thus we draw a line <code>L</code> from the previous 
												bone direction (<code>p<sub>3</sub> - p<sub>4</sub></code>) and position (<code>p<sub>4</sub></code>), 
												then center a cone on the line. This cone is made by the rotational constraints of 
												<code>p<sub>2</sub></code>, named <code>&theta;<sub>1</sub></code>, <code>&theta;<sub>2</sub></code>,
												<code>&theta;<sub>3</sub></code>, and <code>&theta;<sub>4</sub></code>, and the height of the cone is determined by
												the projection of <code>p<sub>2</sub></code> onto the line <code>L</code>, named <code>O</code>. The figure below 
												(figure 4 in the paper) shows how this cone is constructed visually.
											</p>
											<span class="image fit"><a href="#ref-fabrik"><img src="../images/inverse-kinematics/fabrik-fig4-range-of-motion.png" alt="" /></a></span>
											<p>
												The cone acts to constrain the range of motion for the joint <code>p<sub>2</sub></code>, so
												we first need to check if the joint is outside the range of motion. If it isn't, then there
												is no reason to perform rotational constraints. In the example, <code>p<sub>2</sub></code>
												lies outside the range of motion, so it is projected onto the cone, then treated as normal,
												being constrained to the right position based on the initial distance between itself and 
												<code>p<sub>3</sub></code>. 
											</p>
										</div>
									</div> 
									<br/>
									<p>
										I haven't gone over how to determine if the point is within the range of motion or
										how to project the point onto the cone if it is. The basic idea is that the point
										is transformed to the space with <code>O</code> as the origin, then the equation
										of elipse that makes up the quadrant the point is within is solved for with the
										point's <code>x</code>,<code>y</code> values. If the value is <code>>1</code>, then
										the point is outside the range of motion. 
									</p>
									<p>
										For determining the projection onto the cone, the paper solves the eclipse equation
										and line equation (from the origin to the point). This is done by using the Newton-Raphson
										method reference from another paper (Sung Joon Ahn, Wolfgang Rauh, Hans-Jnrgen Warnecke, 
										<em>Least-squares orthogonal distances fitting of circle, sphere, ellipse, hyperbola, 
										and parabola</em>, Pattern Recognition 34, 2001). The method seemed overkill to me,
										especially since FABRIK is already an approximation, so I came up with two alternatives.
									</p>
									<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
										<div class="col-8">
											<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/inverse-kinematics/approach-1-diagram.png" alt="" /></span>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4">
											<p>
												The first alternative method was to pick points along the line, performing essentially a
												binary search to see if the point was inside or outside the eclipse, progressively
												getting closer to the edge of the eclipse.
											</p>
											<p>
												In the figure to the left, the dark red and blue dots are the axis maximums,
												the light red and blue dots are the projection of the point onto the axes,
												and the green elispe is the range of motion.
											</p>
										</div>
									</div>
									<br/>
									<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
										<div class="col-4">
											<p>
												The second approach was to project the axis maximum onto the line from the 
												origin to the target. This was far more approximate but should still work.
											</p>
											<p>
												In the figure to the right, again, the dark red and blue dots are the axis maximums,
												the light red and blue dots are the projection of the point onto the axes,
												and the green elispe is the range of motion.

												<code>z<sub>p</sub></code> and <code>x<sub>p</sub></code> are the projected points
												of point <code>p<sub>i</sub></code> onto the axes for the basis of constraints.
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4">
											<p>
												With either approach, I still had problem with rotational constraints working properly.
												For debugging, I made a visualization that showed the axes of the constrained bones
												as well as the maximum points for the rotational constraints and the projection of the point
												onto the axes. Visually, everything seemed to be in order (I used rotational constraints
												of 45 degrees in each axis). However, the bone chain acted wildly whenever
												the constraints were enforced.
											</p>
										</div>
									</div>
									<br/>
									<p>
										While working on the project, I thought these problems were coming from solving for the
										projection onto the cone incorrectly and thus I spent a lot of time trying to fix this problem.
										However, every approach I took still came up with the same problem. After finishing the project,
										I believe the problem was actually with the spin of the bones, as the "up" direction of the
										basis for the bone joint constraints would change every frame (when constrained), 
										thus making the constrainted point position change rapidly. I think I will return to
										attempt IK in a later project, though I think I might try using a different framework
										than Godot or use Godot's built-in bones. This way, I might be able to get things
										to work as expected, as many of my problems in this project came from conflicts
										between what I expected to happen and how Godot wanted things to work.
