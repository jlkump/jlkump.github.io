									<h3 class="major">Overview</h3>
									<p>
										This project was done as a simple exploration into the
										Godot game engine. Through this project, I became
										more familiar with the Godot's syntax in C# as well
										as with creating event systems to handle game interactions.
										This project was also a chance to explore the creation of
										pixel art assets for games, as all the art seen is hand
										drawn and animated. 
									</p>
									<p>
										A showcase of the game is shown below and beneath that, a
										walkthrough of my process of understanding the Godot engine.

									<p>
										For my game, I implemented a top-down pixel fighter with a character and randomly
										spawning enemies in a small environment. I began first by drawing sprites 
										for the player character. I knew I wanted to do a simple rpg-style fighter,
										and I wanted a golem which would have various states of decay based on the health.
										As such, I designed the character with this in mind (however, it did increase
										the process of creating sprite animations three-fold).

											<p></p>
										</span></div>
									</div>
									<p>
										Next, I designed the enemies with art in a similar way, though they would
										only have two states: activated and deactivated. In the active state, they
										would be able to attack, but deactivated, they would stand still and be open 
										to attack from the player.

									<p>
										Godot, while now supporting 3D games, was originally made for 2D and thus
										it is quite easy to import sprite animations as a 2D sprite sheet. Godot organizes
										the structure of a game in terms of scenes and nodes. Everything in the game is a node, whether it
										be a 2D animated sprite, sound player, or collision shape. These nodes are composed
										into trees of parent and child nodes, creating scenes. A scene could be
										an entity such as the player or enemy, ui elements, or the environment itself. Any scene
										that is created can be saved as, essentially, a prefab. This prefab can be used
										in other scenes to easily create duplicates of the same object.
									</p>
									<p>
										For my project, I created scenes for the player, enemy, main enviornment, as well as for
										the UI elements and environment obstacles. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Interaction with things in the game are handled by attaching scripts to nodes in a scene.
										For handling all interactions, I used C# scripts on the main scene node. This node
										acted as a manager of sorts, handling interactions and sending signals based
										on the current game state. This ensured that no strange interactions occured,
										such as the player being able to move the character in the pause menu or pause while dead.
									</p>
									<p>
										The player character had their own script which would handle 
										<code>CharacterInput</code> events, which would
										either change the velocity of the character to move in the 
										appropriate direction or have the character initiate an attack.
									</p>
									<p>
										The character also emited its own signal when it attempted
										an attack, which the main script would handle by seeing if the 
										attack hit any enemies within the player's attack radius. If it
										did, it would handle killing the enemies and giving the player
										the appropriate number of points. Similarily, if the
										player died, the main scene would recieve a signal and put
										the gamestate in <code>Death</code>.
									</p>
									<p>
										I created other assorted scenes for handling UI interaction
										with similar signal passing as that above with the player character.
										By seperating everything into destinct scenes and connecting them
										using signals, it ensured that no strange or unexpected interactions
										would occur, as well as greatly simpifying the code structure.

									<p>
										While being a fairly simple game, the project was a fun exploration
										into the Godot engine. It was interesting to see the differences
										between Godot and a more heavyweight engine like Unreal, as it
										was much easier to jump into Godot after having learned many
										engine concepts from Unreal.
