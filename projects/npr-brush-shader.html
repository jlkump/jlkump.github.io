									<h1>NPR Brush Shader</h1>
									<hr class="major" />

                                    <h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>
                                        In this project, I explore NPR (Non-Photorealistic Rendering) 
										techniques with a custom post process shader aiming to create 
										the effect of brushstrokes on a model in realtime. 
										I aimed to create a shader which was able to create the
										appearance of a painted scene utilizing artistic techniques
										with shaders in realtime. 
										For research, I used refrence papers 
										<a href="#ref-paint-by-numbers">
											<em>
												Paint By Numbers: Abstract Image Representations
											</em>
										</a>
										by Paul Haeberli and Amy and Bruce Gooch's 
										<a href="https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~ago820/SIG98/abstract.html">
											<em>
												A Non-Photorealistic Lighting Model
												for Automatic Technical Illustration
											</em>
										</a>.
										I implemented the NPR shaders in Opengl using C++, GLFW, and GLEW,
										as well as the boilerplate provided by 
										<a href="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/download/"> Opengl Tutorial</a>.
                                    </p>
									<p>
										A showcase of the result of my work is shown below. Beneath that,
										I have some documentation of my progress on the project and how
										I achieved my results. Finally, I also speculate on alternate avenues
										for achieving artisitc effects through shaders. Here is the

                                    <h2>Process</h2>
									<p>
										This being one of my first major projects with OpenGL
										rather than webGL, I began first by learning OpenGL.
										For this I used the online resource 
										<a href="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org">opengl-tutorial.org</a>,
										which I can highly recommend as it provides all the necessary
										basics you might need for getting started with any OpenGL project.
										Since there's a lot that goes into a build system (and since I
										didn't want to spend time debugging build problems), I used
										the CmakeLists and project structure provided by the tutorial website.
										In the end, this added a lot of bloat to my project structure, so
										for anyone begining with OpenGL, I recommend using 
										<a href="https://github.com/tgalaj/OpenGLSampleCmake?tab=readme-ov-file">this github</a>
										for setting up the build system for your own projects.
                                    </p>
									<p>
										The tutorial's code provided all the necessary baseline
										code for rendering 3D objects with a camera. It also provided
										simple lighting with the Phong Illumination model in some
										shaders. So now, I had to decide on how to approach the problem
										of rendering brushstrokes in realtime for my shader. I had
										initially thought about drawing individual brushstrokes on a
										texture using samples from the scene rendered to texture,
										however, doing this would be difficult to do in parallel
										on the GPU, as each brush stroke would have to be layered
										on the same shared texture. In addition, this would also
										create a new brush texture each frame, sure to be
										extrememly expensive. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I tried a few approaches by creating the textures on the
										CPU, but ultimately they fell through, looking fairly bad with
										poor performance. I moved on to creating a modified illumination
										model for rendering. For this, I used the Gooch Illumination
										model to render objects in a more artistic way.
									</p>
									<p>
										<span class="image left"><img src="../images/npr-shader/before-after-gooche-illumination.png" alt="" /></span>
										The Gooch Illumination model works, at a high level,
										by taking what would normally
										be in darkness and adding cool tones to the model,
										while adding warm tones to the illuminated side. This 
										is what artists normally do in their work, and for
										my rendering, it resulting
										in a more pleasing appearance that is softer on the
										harsh shadows of the Phong lighting model.
									</p>
									<p>
										With the Illumination model much improved, I returned to
										the problem of rendering brush strokes. Originally, I wanted
										to update the brushstrokes on each frame to align with the form of 
										model, however, I couldn't see a way to do this without creating
										a new texture on each frame. So instead, I decided to create a
										static texture of brushstrokes and change the color of them as
										the rendered scene changes.
									</p>
									<p>
										Creating a static frame of brush strokes simplified the
										problem significantly. I would create a series of quads 
										in screen space that each had a brush stroke texture.
										I created the quads on the CPU 
										with a set of parametrizable variables,
										such as <code>BRUSH_SIZE</code>, <code>BRUSH_SIZE_VARIANCE</code>,
										<code>ANGLE</code>, <code>ANGLE_VARIANCE</code>, and <code>COLOR_VARIANCE</code>. 
										Brush size is pretty self explanatory, being the size of an individual brush stroke. 
										Angle is the angle at which the
										brush strokes would be applied on the screen. Color variance is the range
										at which a random amount of color would be added to brush stroke.
										Variance for size and angle also added a random amount to the brush size and
										angle within a given range.
									</p>
									<p>
										To render the result, I simply had to render the scene I had
										previously to texture, then read from that texture in the
										brush stroke shaders. To make sure each brush stroke had
										fairly uniform color, I would sample the rendered texture
										only at the vertices of the brush stroke. The results are shown below.
									</p>
									<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
										<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit">
											<figure><img src="../images/npr-shader/first-iteration-small-strokes.png" alt="" /></figure>
										</span></div>
										<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit">
											<figure><img src="../images/npr-shader/first-iteration-large-strokes.png" alt="" /></figure>
										</span></div>
									</div>
									<p>
										As you can see, this resulted in some strange shadow-like
										artifacts on the final render. This effect was particularly
										apparent with larger brush sizes. I found that the problem
										came from some brushstrokes
										in the lower right having a majority of the brush stroke quad
										with the background color value, but one or two values of the 
										object itself. This resulted in a blended color between the two for a
										brush stroke. A somewhat poor solution to this problem, I simply
										discarded all fragments that had a color close to the background color.
									</p>
									<p>
										After fixing that, the shader really came together. Playing
										with the parameters to the brush strokes a bit, I came
										to some good looking renders:

										<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit">

											<figcaption><h3>Small Splatter Brush Stroke</h3></figcaption></span>
										</div>
									</div>
									<p>
										Also some renders that were more just fun to look at and play around
										with.

										<div class="col-6">

										</div>
									</div>
									<br/>
									<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
										<div class="col-6">
											<p>
												Lastly, I tried to implement having the brush strokes align with the form
												of the model. To do this, I tried to align each brush stroke with the tangents
												and bi-normals of the model in screen space. However, my implementation
												had some problems with it, resulting in some strange effects you can see to the right.
